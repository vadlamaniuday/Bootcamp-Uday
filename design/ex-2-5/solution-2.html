            <h2>Law of the Few</h2>
            <p>
              The Law of the Few, introduced by Malcolm Gladwell in "The Tipping
              Point," suggests that a small group of individuals with unique
              social skills—connectors, mavens, and salesmen—drive significant
              social changes and trends, emphasizing the disproportionate impact
              of key influencers while sparking both widespread application and
              critical debate

            <h2>Quantum Chip: Cryptography Safe</h2>
            <p>
              Google's recent unveiling of its Willow quantum chip has sparked
              discussions about Bitcoin's security, but experts assert that
              breaking modern cryptography remains a distant prospect. As
              reported by Reuters and CNBC, while the chip represents a
              significant advancement in quantum computing, capable of solving
              complex problems in minutes that would take classical
              supercomputers billions of years, it does not pose an immediate
              threat to current encryption methods.

            <h2>Exxon's AI Power Play</h2>
            <p>
              ExxonMobil, the oil and gas giant, is venturing into the booming
              AI-driven data center market with plans to build a natural
              gas-fired power plant equipped with carbon capture technology. As
              reported by TechCrunch, this move reflects the surging electricity
              demands of tech companies, with estimates suggesting that nearly
              half of new AI data centers might face power shortages by 2027

            <h2>Exoplanet's Long Tail</h2>
            <p>
              Astronomers have made a remarkable discovery about WASP-69 b, a
              hot Jupiter exoplanet located 160 light-years from Earth, which
              has been found to possess a colossal comet-like tail stretching
              350,000 miles into space. This extraordinary feature, composed of
              escaping atmospheric gases, offers scientists a unique opportunity
              to study planetary evolution and star-planet interactions in
              real-time.
