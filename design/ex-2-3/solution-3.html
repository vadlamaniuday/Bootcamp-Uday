            <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken

          <p>
            We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
            achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the
            <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>,
            <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major

            There is a continuing need to show the power of
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims
            to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some
            of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load
            the style sheet into this very page. The
            <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the
            same, the only thing that has changed is the external
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.
          </p>
          <p>
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and
            total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way
            this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
            demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the
            hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and
            coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can
            always push it further.

          <p>
            Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying
            this page, so strong
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are necessary
            too, but the example files are commented well enough that even
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them
            as starting points. Please see the

          <p>
            You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the
            <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem
            daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked this way before, but
            follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a
            guide.

            (and please, don&#8217;t submit half-finished work) upload your
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server

            >
            should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong
            fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
            functional, practical
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest
            bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only
            real requirement we have is that your
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have
            implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now.
            When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent
            results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user
            agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in
            mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across
            every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you
            can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome,
            Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the
            population).
          </p>
          <p>
            We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright
            laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to
            incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work.
            We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related
            design.
