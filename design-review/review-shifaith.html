          appropriate color choices.

                  The spacing and the fonts used are good. Provides an
                  additional and accurate information about fonts and it's
                  weights. Gives information about the fonts at the start of the
                  page itself. The code has appropriate color scheming to it and
                  the typography is good. The background color compliments the
                  font and the header is good The color choice is phenomenal.
                  Looked aesthetically and visually pleasing and the font choice
                  was good. Margins and spacing was perfect. In Level 3 , the
                  title is inaccurate. Has to work on that.

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  The Transitional leap from Level 1.1 to level 1.3 was actually
                  consistent. The colors used are easy to the eye and the
                  information was easy to grasp.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  This level could have been improved further if they provided
                  more information regarding as to what they were accomplishing
                  in the first place
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  The colro palette was good but the gradient on the button
                  could be improved further. White is not complementing blue in
                  this one
                  <br />
                </p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>Icons</td>
              <td>8</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong>The use of icons here was seamless.
                  My only NITPICK is that if it was a little bit shorter it
                  would be perfect
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> The SVG did not compliment the color
                  theme and the color choices. It could've been made better if
                  it was used with different color choice. Also the icon grid at
                  the end could be benefitted if there was clear cut info as to
                  what are icons and what are SVGs .
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> The navbar is good. The color of the
                  buttons does not complement the theme followed, if the color
                  was following the theme of the navbar, it would've been better
                  <br />
                </p>

              <td>7.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 and 2:</strong>The use of images here were
                  good. The warm palette used here is absolutely serene and it
                  also provides a small context of the images used would be
                  perfect
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> The responsiveness of the website is
                  good. It lazyloads as it was intended to and provided
                  appropriate alt text when the image is loading
                  <br />
                </p>

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Article was good. Has all of the
                  contents and is following all of the principles for an article
                  post. A user does not have to do additional work for gaining
                  more information and the information falls into the right
                  place at the right time <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This one is actually very
                  good.Would've been benefitted if they added date as well so to
                  know when the article was published
                  <br />
                </p>

              <td>8.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong> This is good. Provided appropriate
                  annotations as to what is wrong when it comes to design
                  choices very well
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>The Mobile UI/UX Comparison could be
                  made better with different color choices because some of the
                  colors are not complimenting the background colors , making it
                  hard to read . All is good with Telangana v/s Michigan
                  paper<br />

                  <strong>Level 3 : </strong> The redesign for the IRCTC website
                  can be done better and can be complimented with better images.
                  The redesign of Faculty About Me page is actually good and
                  provides all of the appropriate context and information needed
                  about the person
                  <br />
