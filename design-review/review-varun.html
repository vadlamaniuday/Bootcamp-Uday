          Everything was good. Design was perfect and layout was consistent all
          across the exercises. Was responsive as well. Loved it.

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  This is good. Provides all of the information and the
                  information is all present for the user in the screen.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 :</strong>

                  This is actually good. Has a background color which is easy to
                  the eye and follows all of the aesthetic and layout choices.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3 :</strong>

                  The background color is good but considering an alternative
                  color for the code would be beneficial, as the current color
                  scheme may be visually straining.

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  This is phenomenal because the information is complementing
                  from each sub exercises and the layout and styling is
                  consistent all across. The color choices for this is insane
                  (in a good way !)
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 and 3: </strong>

                  The dark theme and light theme colors compliment each other
                  and the information structure is actually good. This is
                  aesthetically pleasing and visually good.

              <td>8.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 :</strong> Respects the color choice and it
                  compliments the icons well.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2 :</strong> This works as intended. (NITPICK)
                  Would be better if he actually provided which row was
                  which(had to look into the network tab.)
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> One of the best solutions to the
                  exercise. Provided a download and upload buttons but better
                  icons can be used in place .

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 and 2:</strong>Designs and layouts and styling
                  are actually good. Some context and information, with respect
                  to the image properties would've been beneficial
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> Simple, concise and does what it was
                  supposed to do and also provides the additional context.

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Looks EXACTLY like the OG site. The
                  landing page is phenomenal. Has consistent styling and is
                  aesthetically and visually pleasing.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This one is actually very
                  good.Would've been benefitted if they added date as well so to
                  know when the article was published
                  <br />

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong> One of the best annotations I have
                  ever seen. Provides all of the information without additional
                  work for the user. <br />
                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong> The flow of information is
                  actually good. Has provided images along with additional
                  information to the user for better understanding.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3 : </strong> The redesign for the IRCTC website
                  and the Press release page is good and follows all of the
                  styling and layout and is aesthetically pleasing. One thing a
                  NITPICK is that there is no date in the press release page.
