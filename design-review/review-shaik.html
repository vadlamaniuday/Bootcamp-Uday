          One of the best information structure flow and impeccable aesthecic
          and modern designs I've ever seen in the exercises. The font and color
          choices complement each other well and the website is functional. A
          user does not have to do additional work in order to gain information
          they actually want.

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  This is good. Went from 1.1 to 1.3 in an impeccable manner.
                  Also provided info about font in 1.1 at the top and I didn't
                  have to work hard for it.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  The code has appropriate color scheming to it and the
                  typography is good. The background color compliments the font
                  and the header is good
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  The color choice is phenomenal. Looked aesthetically and
                  visually pleasing and the font choice was good. Margins and
                  spacing was perfect
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  The color Scheming card exercises are one of the best and
                  informative exercises I've seen. It gives all of the
                  information without additional work for the user
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  The dark theme and light theme colors compliment each other
                  well and is visually and aesthetically pleasing.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Apart from the text inside the gradient box everything is
                  good. Provides all of the information I need and follows a
                  good information structure flow.
                  <br />

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> One of the best implemenatations of
                  this website I've seen. The icons are good and compliments the
                  overall dark mode of the website. Also provided info regarding
                  which Icons they've used in the paragraph.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This was good but could be made
                  better if they mentioned as to which row was SVG/ which row
                  was Icons
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> The navbar is good. All the buttons
                  are present and have appropriate icons and have good spacing
                  and margins when it comes to buttons.
                  <br />

                  The Level 1 of the website was good. Provides all of the info
                  but could be made better if additional context as to sizing
                  was provided.

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Article was good. Has all of the
                  contents and is following all of the principles for an article
                  post. A user does not have to do additional work for gaining
                  more information and the information falls into the right
                  place at the right time <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This one is actually very
                  good.Would've been benefitted if they added date as well so to
                  know when the article was published
                  <br />

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong> This is good. Comes with
                  Annotations which gives additional context as to why the
                  website has bad visual choices in the first place
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>The UI/UX Comparison is actually
                  very good. The information structure followed suits well with
                  the design choices they made. <br />

                  <strong>Level 3 : </strong> The redesign has optimal spacing
                  and font and color choices
                  <br />
