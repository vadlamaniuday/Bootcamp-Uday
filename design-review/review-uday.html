                  Provided information about what I achieved while maintaining
                  the aesthetics of the page and layout and styling .
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  Information regarding what are the changes are missing. I
                  would've really liked it if he included the same . Styling can
                  be improved a bit further.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Made aesthetically and visually pleasing and the font choice
                  was good
                </p>

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  The Transitional leap from Level 1.1 to level 1.3 was actually
                  consistent. The colors used are easy to the eye and the
                  information was easy to grasp. Can't say the same for color
                  combination though. Need to work on that.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  The content does not change the color and only the background
                  changes the color. Inaccurate.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  The color swatch is actually very good.Need to add more
                  information regarding the same.

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  The icons are provided on the side of the headings but the
                  overall styling of the page can be improved and can be made
                  more aesthetic.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  Also the icon grid at the end could be benefitted if there was
                  clear cut info as to what are icons and what are SVGs.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  The header could be made better with appropriate color choices
                  and can be made more aesthetic. Background color choices can
                  be also improved.

                  Only the images are provided. Does not tell the end user what
                  it is supposed to do and is left to user's imagination. do.

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  Made this in the form of an article but can be improved
                  further by adding more content regarding the article.

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  Made a responsive Google Article Clone but it is still
                  barebones. Can be styled better with appropriate styling
                  techniques.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  Article was good. Would be benefitted with more content and
                  date uploaded on a side of the card <br />

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  In the Annotations exercise, the styling could be better and
                  can use a grid layout instead of a vertical layout

                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  The UI/UX analysis exercise could be benefitted if if images
                  were provided <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  The redesigns are provided in a Figma Format, but can be made
                  in a webpage . Could work on that. The layout and styling
                  looks like as if it is from 2000s and not modern. <br />
