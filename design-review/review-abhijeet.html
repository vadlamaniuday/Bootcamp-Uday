          The exercise would have been even more valuable with the addition of
          context and real content instead of placeholder text. I kindly suggest
          including more detailed information and context in future iterations
          to enhance the overall effectiveness

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  Did not add a snippet of JS Code. It does look functional but
                  a little bit of styling is needed
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  Looks much better than Level 1 but a little bit of more
                  styling is needed
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Changed the fonts as asked. That's good, but the typographic
                  hierarchy is absent
                </p>

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  Looks good, provides all of the information which was asked.
                  But the information could be provided in a better structure.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  Same as Level 1. Provides all of the info, but does not
                  provide any information regarding the swatches
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  This was actually very good. The information was provided in a
                  clear and concise manner while the consistency was being
                  maintained
                  <br />

              <td>Icons</td>
              <td>7</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> It would have been helpful if there
                  was some context or even a brief heading
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Same as level 1.it would be
                  beneficial if there was some context
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>The download and upload buttons are
                  just some arrow buttons. It would be better if it was a
                  download and upload icon
                  <br />
                </p>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>Images</td>
              <td>6.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Some context, with respect to the
                  image properties would've been beneficial.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This was actually good. It was
                  responsive as well. I like how it follows the guidelines on
                  how to post an article. (NITPICK) : I would've liked if it was
                  a paragraph instead of Lorem Ipsum though
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> Just an image. Additional context
                  would've been benificial
                  <br />

              <td>7</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Not present
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This was actually good. (NITPICK) :
                  I would've really liked if the navbar would've been at a
                  corner (left or right, but just any corner)
                  <br />
                </p>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>6</td>
              <td>Design Principles and Redesign</td>
              <td>8</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> This is good. Information is
                  presented well but I would've really liked it if the images
                  were stacked left and right, instead of top to bottom.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Redesign was actually very good. I
                  liked the hover effect and modern interface. Provides you a
                  small context as to what's the content inside as well
                  <br />
                </p>
