        <h4>
          I liked this because the styling and design choices was consistent all
          across the exercises and they are visually pleasing as well

                  The Transition and Consistency from Level 1.1 to Level 1.3 is
                  good. It was good and function from 1.1 itself and only became
                  better and better
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  This is actually good but the color coding in the following
                  links are not good. Apart from this , rest all is good
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  This was actually good. It was as if I'm reading a Hashnode
                  article(Check that out) and a dev.to blog
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  This was actually good and visually and aesthetically
                  pleasing, all the buttons work and provides all of the
                  information and has respectable spacing when it comes to
                  margin and padding
                  <br />
                </p>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>Icons</td>
              <td>8.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Very good. Respects the color choice
                  and it compliments the icons well.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This could've been neatly benefitted
                  if it was mentioned that which row is which.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> The navbar is good. All the buttons
                  are present and have appropriate icons and have good spacing
                  and margins when it comes to buttons
                  <br />
                </p>
              </td>

              <td>4</td>
              <td>Images</td>
              <td>9</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  Added a small context to the images and fits well inside the
                  card. Loved this one. It is responsive and follows the lazy
                  loading as intended in the exercise as well.

              <td>8.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Article was good. Has all of the
                  contents and is following all of the principles for an article
                  post. A user does not have to do additional work for gaining
                  more information and the information falls into the right
                  place at the right time <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This one is even good.Would've been
                  benefitted if they added date as well <br />

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong> This is good but it would be
                  better if they mentioned what was wrong when it comes to
                  visual designs in the website along with annotations.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>No Ui/UX Comparison present <br />

                  <strong>Level 3 : </strong> The redesign is one of the best
                  out of the box thinking I've ever seen
                  <br />
