                  a better modern website which follows all of the aesthetics
                  structure. Loved reading it.

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  The color scheme is good and it has all of the modern
                  aesthetics of a website while preserving the information
                  structure .

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Very good. Respects the color choice
                  and it compliments the icons well and provides the information
                  and context about the icons.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Best implementations of SVG and
                  Icons are good and it works as intended

                  gradient and phenomenal icons.

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Provides information about the
                  images and builds on top of that while also providing the
                  image properties.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Gives information about the
                  compressed image as well while being consistent in styling and
                  layout.
                  <br />

                  does what it was supposed to do while being responsive and

                  if it is real deal.

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> The featured article sections is
                  perfect but can be enhanced with more information such as

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Actually very good Would've loved if
                  there were annotated images present. The UI/UX of
                  Amazon/Flipkart comparison would've been benefitted if he only
                  provided the winner instead of choosing two different colors.

                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Redesign was actually very good. I
                  liked the hover effect and modern interface. The IIT-M page is
                  now up to date and is modern and aesthetic
                  <br />
