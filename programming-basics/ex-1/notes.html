        <p>
          This exercise was a basic setup of a project using Node and npm . Had
          to install Chalk for prettying up console logs and nodemon for
          monitioring the server. Encountered some bugs here and there with
          respect to chalk and DEBUG but managed to fix them.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Challenges I faced</h3>
        <p>
          Some of the challenges I faced was during the initial setup for Chalk
          and prestart scripts. I spent like, 20 minutes looking for a solution
          for pre-start scripts and some of the suggestions on stackoverflow was
          to create a new file and link the file, but I knew there has to be an
          easy way.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At last I did find the solution for it but I believe that the solution
          has a room for improvement.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Resources I used</h3>
        <p>
          I have used forums such as Stack overflow and github issue tracker but
          mainly for fixing bugs.

      <div class="improvements">
        <h3 style="text-align: center">Improvements</h3>
        <p>
          Though my solution of pre-start script works only for windows based
          systems, I have to find a permanent solution for it so that it is
          compatible with other platforms.
