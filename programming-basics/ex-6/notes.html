          This exercise was easy but it took me a bit of a time because I could
          not get YAML to work with config. While reading the docs I found that
          I had to use another library called js-yaml in order for config
          library to work, but finding this solution took me a bit of a time and
          half of the time spent on this exercise was finding this particular
          solution itself.

          How to get the config package to work with JS, at first I just
          installed config and tried to run the default.yaml file but since that
          did not work, I had to find a way for the YAML to work with config, so
          a library called js-yaml came to the rescue.

        <p>
          A lot of resources (mainly for config) came in handy here including
          but not limited to :

          <li>Stack overflow</li>

        <p>
          I believe since we are using YAML , the code can further be optimised
          and modularized.
