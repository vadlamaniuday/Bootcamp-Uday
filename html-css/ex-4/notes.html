    <h3>Exercise 4: CSS Units and Responsive Design</h3>
    <p>
      Goal: Practice using various CSS units and make the design responsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Introduction: Learn to work with different CSS units and responsive
      techniques. Know about px, em, rem, ch, etc. Also units like vh, vw. Learn
      about min, max, and clamp() to help in creating scalable designs.
    </p>
    <h4>Level 1:</h4>
    <p>
      Create a centered webpage layout using %, vh, and vw. Center a content
      block horizontally and vertically.
    </p>
    <h4>Level 2:</h4>
    <p>
      Use min(), max(), and clamp() for font sizes and widths. Style the page
      content to scale proportionally across different screen sizes.
    </p>
    <h4>Level 3:</h4>
    <p>
      Implement continuous responsiveness by avoiding fixed breakpoints. Use
      advanced responsive techniques like flexible grids and fluid typography.

          <li>
            px (pixels) are useful for precise control but not ideal for
            responsive design.
          </li>
          <li>
            em are useful for scaling elements relative to their parent's font
            size.
          </li>
          <li>
            rem are relative to the font-size of the root element and provide a
            consistent scaling across the entire document.
          </li>
          <li>
            % are useful for creating fluid layouts because they are relative to
            the parent element's size.
          </li>
          <li>
            vh (viewport height) and vw (viewport width) are used for creating
            elements that scale with the viewport height and width respectively.
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            min and max return the smallest and largest value among the provided
            values respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            clamp() "clamps" a value between a minimum and maximum value and is
            useful for creating responsive typography and layouts.

        <h6><strong>Findings</strong></h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Responsiveness ensures that the webpage adapts dynamically across
            all screen sizes and devices by avoiding fixed breakpoints.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fluid typography means that text sizes adjust proportionally to the
            viewport dimensions to maintain aesthetic consistency and
            readability.
