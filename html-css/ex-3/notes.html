      Take the blog post content provided:

            Normalize CSS is a lightweight CSS file created to ensure that
            browsers render HTML components consistently and in accordance with
            current standards.

          <li>
            Markdown can be converted to HTML by using online converters or we
            can use a Python library called Markdown to convert the same.

          <li>
            Classless CSS allows you to style any plain-HTML page just by linking to
            the stylesheet, removing the need to define special classes you
            must add to your HTML elements to style these elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            I used Pico CSS for Solution 3 and for this notes file, I'm using
            Classless.de (Going forward, I'm going to make use of Classless.de
            for notes).
          </li>
          <li>
            The reasoning for choosing Pico for Solution 3 is that if we're
            using the NPM or downloaded version, we can customize it according
            to our needs.
