      <h4>Review Overview</h4>
      <div id="tldr">
        <p>
          The SKB research website implemets a very well functioning app that
          lets the user search through the papers by filters such as title, year
          and citations.But the design looks very pale and outdated.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>1. Layout</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The website's layout is clean and
          well-organized, using a grid system for easy navigation and quick
          scanning of research papers. The search bar and filter options are
          positioned at left side for easy access.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Filters:</strong> The site offers well-organized and
          user-friendly filter options for title, citations, and year ranges,
          effectively refining search results and enhancing site functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Results Display:</strong> The results are displayed in a clear
          and readable format in a grid layout. Each card contains essential
          information such as Authos, citations, abstract, year and references.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Styling</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> The current color scheme, while
          visually appealing and professional, could be improved for better
          contrast and visual interest in the card design. Implementing a theme
          switcher functionality would also enhance user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typography:</strong> The font choices are simple and readable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buttons and Icons:</strong> The buttons and icons are
          well-designed and intuitive. The "Export Data" button is clearly
          labeled and stands out, making it easy for users to export their
          search results. However, the pagination numbers are not clearly
          visible and could be improved for better user experience.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Information Flow</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Search Functionality:</strong> The search bar allows users to
          search by various criteria, making it easy to find specific research
          papers. The filter options further enhance the search functionality by
          allowing users to refine their search results by Author, year,
          citations.
        </p>

        <h4>Improvements</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Enhancing Visual Appeal:</strong> To elevate the user
          experience, incorporating subtle visual elements or nuanced color
          variations could make the interface more captivating and interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dynamic Filtering:</strong> Implementing dynamic filters that
          adapt to user input would significantly enhance the search
          functionality. Additionally, including filters for abstracts and the
          ability to search across all columns would provide users with more
          comprehensive search capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Refining Styling:</strong> Building upon the existing
          professional and clean aesthetic, introducing thoughtful visual
          elements or subtle color variations could further enrich the
          interface, making it more engaging and user-friendly.
