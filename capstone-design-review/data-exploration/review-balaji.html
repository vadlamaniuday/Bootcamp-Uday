                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  The Leap from Level 1.1 to 1.3 is phenomenal. Also provided
                  all of the information regarding the changes made below the
                  topic
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  Same as Level 1. Went from a basic website with aesthetics to
                  a better modernwebsite which follows all of the aesthetics
                  structure. Loved reading it.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Looks good, provides all of the information which was asked.
                  But the information could be provided in a better structure.

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  The leap is good but the color scheme he chose could be better
                  (went from pink to blue) which could be better if he chose to
                  stay with a single color
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  Actually very good. The color choice in dark mode is actually
                  perfect and easy to the eye as well.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Color swatch generator is good. Provided all of the
                  information in a structured manner and follows the information
                  structure

              <td>8</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Very good. Respects the color choice
                  and it compliments the icons well.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This works as intended. (NITPICK)
                  Would be better if he actually provided which row was
                  which(had to look into the network tab.)
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>One of the best solutions to the
                  exercise. Provided a download and upload buttons and provides
                  appropriate context and icons for the buttons as well
                  <br />

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Added information about what changes
                  he did.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This was actually good.. (NITPICK)
                  :Image properties could've been added along with the
                  compressed image properties
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> This is good. Simple, concise and
                  does what it was supposed to do.

                  One of the best medium clones I've seen with just HTML, CSS.
                  Follows all of the spacing and margin guidelines.

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Actually very good Would've loved if
                  there were annotated images present. The UI/UX of
                  Amazon/Flipkart comparison would've been benefitted if he only
                  provided the winner instead of choosing two different colors.

                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Redesign was actually very good. I
                  liked the hover effect and modern interface. Provides you a
                  small context as to what's the content inside as well
