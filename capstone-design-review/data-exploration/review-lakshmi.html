          this is well-done. However, the absence of the 'zen garden' in
          Exercise 1 and the functional aspects in Exercise 2, Level 2, have
          affected the score.

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  This is good , does what it was supposed to do. But it did not
                  follow the guidelines of changing the same in CSS Zen Garden
                  Template.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  Same as Level 1. Went from a basic website with aesthetics to
                  a better modern website which follows all of the aesthetics
                  structure. NITPICK is that it shouldve followed the Zen Garden
                  Template
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Looks good, provides all of the information which was asked.
                  But the information could be provided in a better structure.
                  (the code looks normal , meaning that there is no distinction
                  as to if it's a code or a paragraph)
                </p>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>Colors</td>
              <td>6</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  This is good. Does what it was asked for while having good
                  margins and padding and font spacing. Reading this was a charm
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  The information is present but does not work. I changed my
                  themes 2 times to see if it was working or not but this does
                  not work. Also the button does nothing .
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  This was actually good and visually and aesthetically
                  pleasing.

              <td>8</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Very good. Respects the color choice
                  and it compliments the icons well. (NITPICK) Would've loved it
                  more if the icons had a small context
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This could've been neatly benefitted
                  if it was mentioned that which row is which. Right now it's a
                  mixture of both SVG and image
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> This is good. Simple, concise and
                  does what it was supposed to do, also the color scheme
                  compliments the icons and the background well
                  <br />

                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Would be good if they added
                  information about what changes they did.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This was actually good.. (NITPICK)
                  :Image properties could've been added along with the
                  compressed image properties
                  <br />

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Article was good. Would be better if
                  there was a context about the image added . Liked the visual
                  styling of this <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Article was good. Would be
                  benefitted with more content and date uploaded on a side of
                  the card <br />
