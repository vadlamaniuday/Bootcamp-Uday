      <h5>The Structure I followed for reviewing the designs</h5>
      <p>
        As someone who gives more weightage to functionality and the ease of
        accessing info than aesthetics and styling, I followed the following
        strucutre for reviewing my peers' works :
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Usability:</strong> I only looked into how easy it is for
          users to accomplish whatever they want to achieve with the website.
          This includes navigation, layout, and overall user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Information Architecture:</strong> How the information is
          presented and strucutured.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance:</strong> Looked into the loading times (in
          network Tab in console window).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistency:</strong> Whether overall design is consistent in
          each and every page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsiveness:</strong>Whether the webpages are
          responsiveness or not.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h6 style="color: red">
        One thing I'd like to let people know upfront is that I am bad at UI/UX
        (currently improving this, thanks to this bootcamp) and that my opinion
        might be biased since I prefer functionality over aesthetics.
