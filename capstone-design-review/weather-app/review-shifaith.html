        <h4>1. Layout</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The layout is clean and well-organized.
          The website is divided into two main sections: Static Weather Widgets
          and Interactive Weather Widget. This clear separation helps users
          quickly understand the different types of widgets available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Widget Display:</strong> Each weather widget is presented in a
          card format, which is visually appealing and easy to read. The cards
          are uniformly styled, making the information consistent and easy to
          compare.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Interactive Elements:</strong> The interactive section
          includes a form for users to enter a city name and get the weather
          information. This feature is well-placed and easy to use, enhancing
          the user experience.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Styling</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> The use of a light blue color scheme
          creates a calming and professional look. The colors are easy on the
          eyes and enhance readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typography:</strong> The font choices are simple and readable.
          The use of different font sizes and weights helps in distinguishing
          between headings and body text.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buttons and Icons:</strong> The buttons are well-designed and
          intuitive. The "Show Weather" button in the interactive section is
          clearly labeled and stands out, making it easy for users to interact
          with the widget.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Information Flow</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Content Presentation:</strong> The information is presented in
          a clear and concise manner. Each weather widget card provides
          essential information such as temperature, weather condition,
          humidity, and wind speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Interactive Functionality:</strong> The interactive widget
          allows users to search for weather information in any city, making the
          site highly functional and user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Navigation:</strong> The layout and design make it easy for
          users to navigate through the different sections of the website. The
          clear division between static and interactive widgets helps users
          quickly find the information they need.
        </p>

        <h4>Nitpicking</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Additional Features:</strong> While the website is functional
          and user-friendly, it could benefit from additional features such as a
          search bar for static widgets or more detailed weather information
          (e.g., hourly forecasts, air quality index).
