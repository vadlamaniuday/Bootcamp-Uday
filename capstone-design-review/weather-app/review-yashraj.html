      <h4>TLDR Review</h4>
      <p>
        The Weather Widget is a compact and user-friendly tool with a clean and
        modern design. The dark theme with a light widget card creates a
        visually appealing contrast. The layout is straightforward, making it
        easy for users to get the weather information they need quickly. The
        widget effectively presents essential weather details in an accessible
        manner.
      </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>1. Layout</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The layout is simple and well-organized.
          The search bar for entering the city name is prominently placed at the
          top of the widget, making it easy for users to start their search
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Results Display:</strong> The weather results are displayed in
          a clear and readable format within a card. The city name, weather
          icon, condition, temperature, feels-like temperature, and humidity are
          neatly arranged, making the information easily scannable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Navigation:</strong> The layout is intuitive, with the search
          bar and button placed above the weather card. This arrangement ensures
          that users can easily input a new city and get updated weather
          information without navigating away from the current view.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Styling</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> The use of a dark background with a
          light widget card creates a modern and professional look. The color
          scheme is easy on the eyes and enhances readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typography:</strong> The font choices are simple and readable.
          The use of different font sizes and weights helps in distinguishing
          between headings and body text.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buttons and Icons:</strong> The buttons are well-designed and
          intuitive. The "Search" button is clearly labeled and stands out,
          making it easy for users to retrieve weather information. The weather
          icon within the card adds a visual element that enhances the user
          experience.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Content</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Detail Level:</strong> The content is concise and informative.
          Each weather result includes essential details such as the city name,
          condition, temperature, feels-like temperature, and humidity. This
          level of detail is sufficient for users looking for quick weather
          updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Usefulness:</strong> The widget provides the necessary weather
          information in a straightforward manner. The inclusion of the
          temperature, feels-like temperature, and humidity is particularly
          useful for users planning their day.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Information Flow</h4>
        <p>
          The information flow is good as the user does not have to do extra
          efforts in order to get the weather information they actually want.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Navigation:</strong> The layout and design make it easy for
          users to navigate through the search results. The placement of the
          search bar and button above the weather card ensures a smooth user
          experience.
