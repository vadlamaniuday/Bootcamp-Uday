        <h4>1. Layout</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The layout is clean and well-organized.
          The website is divided into clear sections for entering the city name
          and displaying the weather information. This separation helps users
          quickly understand and interact with the dashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Search Bar:</strong> The search bar is prominently placed at
          the top, making it easy for users to input the city name and update
          the weather information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Weather Display:</strong> The weather information is presented
          in a card format, which is visually appealing and easy to read. The
          card includes essential details such as temperature, weather
          condition, humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility, and cloud
          cover.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Styling</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> The use of a dark background with light
          text creates a modern and professional look. The color scheme is easy
          on the eyes and enhances readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typography:</strong> The font choices are simple and readable.
          The use of different font sizes and weights helps in distinguishing
          between headings and body text.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buttons and Icons:</strong> The buttons are well-designed and
          intuitive. The "UPDATE WEATHER" button is clearly labeled and stands
          out, making it easy for users to interact with the dashboard. The
          icons next to each weather detail add a visual element that enhances
          understanding.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Information Flow</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Content Presentation:</strong> The information is presented in
          a clear and concise manner. Each weather detail is accompanied by an
          icon, making it easy for users to quickly understand the information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Interactive Functionality:</strong> The interactive feature
          allows users to search for weather information in any city, making the
          site highly functional and user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Navigation:</strong> The layout and design make it easy for
          users to navigate through the different sections of the website. The
          clear division between the search bar and the weather display helps
          users quickly find the information they need.
