          The Simple Weather App is a user-friendly and visually appealing tool
          for checking weather conditions. Its minimalistic layout features a
          clear search bar and well-organized weather information display. The
          styling is modern and clean, with a pleasant color scheme and legible
          text. The information flow is intuitive, allowing users to quickly
          find weather details and recommendations for any city.

          The app features a search bar at the top where users can enter the
          city name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below the search bar, the weather information for the searched city is
          displayed.

          The design is minimalistic, with a clear separation between the input

        <h2>Styling</h2>
        <p>The styling is clean and modern.</p>
        <p>
          The use of a blue background provides a pleasant contrast to the white
          content area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The search button is prominently colored in blue, making it easily
          noticeable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weather information is presented in a card-like format, which is
          visually appealing and easy to read.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text is clear and legible, with a good use of font sizes and
          weights.

          condition (e.g., Overcast), and a brief description or recommendation
          based on the weather.
