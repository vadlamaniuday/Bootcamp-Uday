        The styling and layout is consistent all across the exercises. Though
        this exercise would be benefitted with the presence of images and icons.

                One of the most consistent and visuallly pleasing submissions
                I've seen with respect to styling. The information structure
                flows well and the color and font choice is good.

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong> The color Scheming card exercises
                  are one of the best and informative exercises I've seen. It
                  gives all of the information without additional work for the
                  user.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong> The dark and light theme exercise
                  is good, but the text in the color swatch exercises can be
                  improved further. <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong> The gradient button exercise is
                  good and easy to the eyes. The color choice of the button is
                  not complementing the background color.

              <td>Icons</td>
              <td>6.5</td>
              <td>
                <strong>Level 1 : </strong> The use of icons are good and the
                color palette respects the background theme. NITPICK : The
                numbers are on the left, the content is in the middle of the
                page. That can be fixed
                <br />
                <strong>Level 2 : </strong> This is good, but if the information
                regarding which images are SVG and which are icons were
                provided, it would've been better<br />

                <strong>Level 3: </strong> There are no icons present in this.,

                <strong>Level 1 : </strong> Some context, with respect to the
                image properties would've been beneficial.
                <br />
                <strong>Level 2 : </strong> Provided all of the info as to what
                this exercise was actually supposed to be doing NITPICK :
                Could've been better if context regarding the properties are
                given <br />

                <strong>Level 3: </strong> Just an image. Additional context
                would've been better

              <td>8.5</td>
              <td>
                <strong>Level 1 : </strong> One of the best medium clones I've
                seen with just HTML, CSS. Follows all of the spacing and margin
                guidelines.
                <br />
                <strong>Level 2 : </strong> This one is actually very
                good.Would've been benefitted if they added date as well so to
                know when the article was published <br />

              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 & 2:</strong>
                  The content is strong and the styling is good, the information
                  structure flows perfectly and the points are valid as well.
                  The UI UX comparison is also good, styling of the tables are
                  good and is told what is asked, good for me.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3 :</strong>
                  The Website redesign is good but can be improved in terms of
                  images and spacing and layout
                  <br />
