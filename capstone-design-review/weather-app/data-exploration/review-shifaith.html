        <p>
          This website is a well-designed, functional, and user-friendly website
          for searching and filtering research papers. The layout is clean and
          organized, with a prominent search bar and intuitive filter options.
          The styling is professional and readable, though the authors' format
          could be improved. Overall, the site effectively presents a large
          amount of information in an accessible manner.

        <h4>1. Layout</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The layout is clean and well-organized.
          The search bar at the top is prominently placed, making it easy for
          users to start their search immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Filters:</strong> The filter options on the left side are
          neatly arranged, allowing users to refine their search by abstract,
          authors, number of citations, references, and title. This makes the
          site highly functional and user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Results Display:</strong> The research paper results are
          displayed in a clear and readable format on the right side. Each paper
          card contains essential information such as title, authors, year,
          abstract, citations, references, and venue.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Styling</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> The use of a light background with dark
          text creates a professional and clean look. The color scheme is easy
          on the eyes and enhances readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typography:</strong> The font choices are simple and readable.
          The use of different font sizes and weights helps in distinguishing
          between headings and body text.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buttons and Icons:</strong> The buttons and icons are
          well-designed and intuitive. The "Export Data" button is clearly
          labeled and stands out, making it easy for users to export their
          search results.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Information Flow</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Search Functionality:</strong> The search bar allows users to
          search across all fields, making it easy to find specific research
          papers. The filter options further enhance the search functionality by
          allowing users to refine their search results.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Detail Level:</strong> Each research paper card provides a
          good level of detail, including the title, authors, year, abstract,
          citations, references, and venue. This allows users to get a
          comprehensive overview of each paper without being overwhelmed by too
          much information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Navigation:</strong> The layout and design make it easy for
          users to navigate through the search results and filters. The
          pagination at the bottom (not visible in the screenshot) would likely
          be well-placed and easy to use.
        </p>

        <h4>Nitpicking</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Authors Format:</strong> The authors are displayed in an array
          format (e.g., ["S. Ben Jabra", "Ezzeddine Zagrouba"]). This format is
          not very user-friendly and could be improved. A more readable format,
          such as a comma-separated list, would be better (e.g., "S. Ben Jabra,
          Ezzeddine Zagrouba").
