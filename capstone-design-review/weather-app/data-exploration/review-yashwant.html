      <h4>TLDR Review</h4>
      <p>
        Streamify is a sleek and modern music streaming platform with a
        user-friendly interface. The dark theme is visually appealing and easy
        on the eyes. The search and filter functionalities are robust, and the
        layout is clean and well-organized. The site effectively presents a
        large amount of information in an accessible manner, making it easy for
        users to find and play their favorite songs.

        <h4>1. Layout</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The layout is clean and well-organized.
          The search bars for artists and song names are prominently placed at
          the top, making it easy for users to start their search immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Filters:</strong> The filter options for genres and popularity
          levels are neatly arranged below the search bars. This allows users to
          refine their search results effectively, enhancing the site's
          functionality and user-friendliness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Results Display:</strong> The song results are displayed in a
          clear and readable format in a grid layout. Each song card contains
          essential information such as title, artist, album, popularity, genre,
          and duration, along with a play button.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Styling</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> The use of a dark background with light
          text creates a modern and professional look. The color scheme is easy
          on the eyes and enhances readability, especially in low-light
          conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typography:</strong> The font choices are simple and readable.
          The use of different font sizes and weights helps in distinguishing
          between headings and body text.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buttons and Icons:</strong> The buttons and icons are
          well-designed and intuitive. The "Download Filtered Data" button is
          clearly labeled and stands out, making it easy for users to download
          their search results. The play buttons on each song card are also
          prominently displayed.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Information Flow</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Search Functionality:</strong> The search bars allow users to
          search by artist and song name, making it easy to find specific songs.
          The filter options further enhance the search functionality by
          allowing users to refine their search results by genre and popularity
          level.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Detail Level:</strong> Each song card provides a good level of
          detail, including the title, artist, album, popularity, genre, and
          duration. This allows users to get a comprehensive overview of each
          song without being overwhelmed by too much information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Navigation:</strong> The layout and design make it easy for
          users to navigate through the search results and filters. The
          pagination at the bottom is well-placed and easy to use, allowing
          users to browse through multiple pages of results.
        </p>

        <h4>Nitpicking</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Genre and Popularity Filters:</strong> While the genre and
          popularity filters are useful, they could be more prominently
          displayed or have additional options for more granular filtering. For
          example, allowing users to select multiple genres or specify a range
          for popularity levels could enhance the filtering functionality.
