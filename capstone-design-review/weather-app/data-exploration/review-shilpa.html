          Some of the exercises are good but some of the exercises lack depth of
          information and content I kindly suggest including more detailed
          information and context in future iterations to enhance the overall
          effectiveness

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  Level 1 was good. They used the CSS Zen Garden template and
                  added the Snippet of JS code there and styled it accordingly.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 and Level 3: </strong>

                  Provided information as to what the changes were made. But
                  could be improved further if they stick to the CSS Zen
                  Template
                  <br />
                </p>
              </td>

              <td>2</td>
              <td>Colors</td>
              <td>8</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  This is phenomenal because the information is complementing
                  from each sub exercises and the layout and styling is
                  consistent all across
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  This is actually good too. One NITPICK is that the card
                  doesn't change the theme if we switch from dark to light theme
                  and is hard on eyes if used with dark theme. Apart from that
                  this is good
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  The color swatch one is actually good. Provides all of the
                  information while being consistent in styling and layout and
                  does not compromise on information
                  <br />

              <td>6.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 & 2:</strong>It would have been helpful if
                  there was some context regarding the icons
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> The download and upload buttons are
                  just buttons. It would be better if it was a download and
                  upload icon.

                  <strong>Level 1 and 2:</strong>Some context and information,
                  with respect to the image properties would've been beneficial
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> Just an image. Additional context
                  would've been benificial

                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Article was good. Has all of the
                  contents and is following all of the principles for an article
                  post except the date. <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> This one is actually very
                  good.Would've been benefitted if they added date as well so to
                  know when the article was published
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong> The points as to what are the
                  problems with respect to the IRCTC are actually very valid and
                  good. If they were supported with images or annotations it
                  would be perfect. Just a nitpick though. <br />
                  <strong>Level 3 : </strong> The redesign for the IRCTC website
                  can be done better and can be complimented with better images.
                  Rest assured, the information flow and structrue is actually
                  good.
