                  Added information about what changes he did. (NITPICK) : I
                  would've liked it if he added these information at the start
                  of the page instead of adding it in the end
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  Information regarding what are the changes are missing. I
                  would've really liked it if he included the same
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  Changed the fonts as asked. Functional, responsive and works
                  really well.

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  Cards are actually good. Does what it is supposed to do.
                  (NITPICK) Would've loved if he added what does the card
                  accomplish. I mean I know that , but it's better to provide
                  the same.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  Works as intended. Does what it is supposed to do and provides
                  additional info regarding HSL
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  The only nitpick I have in this is that it would've been
                  better if the button is of different color / gradient

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  There are no icons present.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  This is good. DOes what is required to do. Would've loved if
                  any info regarding which row was SVG/Icons would've been
                  better. I had to use network tab to see those.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  The design is actually preferable (by me, ofcourse.). The only
                  nitpicking I have are that icons on top left could've been
                  made to hover so that the user could know . Another is that
                  the download and upload button should've been complemented
                  with icons

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  This is good. Simple, concise and does what it was supposed to
                  do.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  This is also good. Provided all of the info as to what this
                  exercise was actually supposed to be doing <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>
                  This is well-done. Provided all the necessary information to
                  clearly explain the purpose of this exercise.

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  This clone is actually good. Could've benefitted if there was
                  more spacing and could've used different images
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  The header text could've been beneficial if a different font
                  was chosen instead of white <br />

                  <strong>Level 1: </strong>

                  The information is present but the exercise could be further
                  enhanced with the inclusion of annotations. This would greatly
                  improve clarity and understanding
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2: </strong>

                  The redesign of faculty page and the IRCTC Design is actually
                  good. I would've loved if more info was present <br />
