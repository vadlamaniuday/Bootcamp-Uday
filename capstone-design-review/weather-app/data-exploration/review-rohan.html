      <h4>TLDR Review</h4>
      <p>
        The Research Papers Explorer is a well-designed platform with a clean
        layout, professional styling, comprehensive content, and a logical
        information flow. It effectively meets the needs of researchers and
        academics looking for detailed information on research papers. Minor
        improvements in visual engagement could enhance the user experience
        further.

        <h4>1. Layout</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The layout of the website is clean and
          well-organized. The use of a grid system to display research papers is
          effective, making it easy for users to scan through multiple entries
          quickly. The search bar and filter options at the top are prominently
          placed, ensuring users can easily find what they are looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Filters:</strong> The filter options for institution, journal,
          and year are neatly arranged, allowing users to refine their search
          results effectively. This enhances the site's functionality and
          user-friendliness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Results Display:</strong> The research paper results are
          displayed in a clear and readable format in a grid layout. Each card
          contains essential information such as authors, journal, year,
          citations, institution, field, impact factor, DOI, and keywords, along
          with export options.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Styling</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> The use of a light background with dark
          text creates a professional and clean look. The color scheme is easy
          on the eyes and enhances readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typography:</strong> The font choices are simple and readable.
          The use of different font sizes and weights helps in distinguishing
          between headings and body text.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buttons and Icons:</strong> The buttons and icons are
          well-designed and intuitive. The "Export Data" button is clearly
          labeled and stands out, making it easy for users to export their
          search results. The pagination controls at the bottom are also
          well-designed.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Content</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Detail Level:</strong> The content is comprehensive and
          well-structured. Each research paper entry includes essential details
          such as authors, journal, year, citations, institution, field, impact
          factor, DOI, and keywords. This level of detail is beneficial for
          researchers and academics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Usefulness:</strong> The inclusion of DOI links is
          particularly useful for accessing the full papers. The keywords and
          impact factor provide additional context and relevance.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Information Flow</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Search Functionality:</strong> The search bar allows users to
          search by various criteria, making it easy to find specific research
          papers. The filter options further enhance the search functionality by
          allowing users to refine their search results by institution, journal,
          and year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Navigation:</strong> The layout and design make it easy for
          users to navigate through the search results and filters. The
          pagination at the bottom is well-placed and easy to use, allowing
          users to browse through multiple pages of results.
        </p>

        <h4>Nitpicking</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Visual Engagement:</strong> While the design is clean and
          professional, adding some visual elements or slight variations in
          color could make the interface more engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Filter Options:</strong> The filter options could be more
          prominently displayed or have additional options for more granular
          filtering. For example, allowing users to select multiple institutions
          or specify a range for the year could enhance the filtering
          functionality.
