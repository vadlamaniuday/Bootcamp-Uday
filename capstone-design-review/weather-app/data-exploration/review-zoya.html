      <h4>This is well-done. However, the absence of the 'zen garden' in Exercise 1 and can be benefitted with using appropriate color choices </h4>

                  The content is good, so is styling and information is
                  presentbut does not follow the guidelines of CSS Zen Garden
                  Template.

                  <strong>Level 1 : </strong>

                  This is good because the information is complementing from
                  each sub exercises and the layout and styling is consistent
                  all across
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2 : </strong>

                  Actually very good. The color choice in dark mode is actually
                  perfect and easy to the eye as well.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3: </strong>

                  The HSL is actually very good and provides all of the
                  information . The gradients are good and is complimenting the
                  background color and is aesthetically pleasing
                  <br />

              <td>Icons</td>
              <td>7.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1 and Level 2:</strong> The icons used are
                  subtle and mixes with the content and styling well but did NOT
                  make use of SVGs as mentioned in Level 2.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 3:</strong>The icons in the download and upload
                  buttons have an aesthetic gradient and phenomenal icons.
                  <br />

              <td>7.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Provides information about the
                  images and builds on top of that but image properties were
                  desirable.
                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Does not give information about the
                  compressed image but the styling and layout is consistent all
                  across the exercise.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Level 3:</strong> This is good. Simple, concise and
                  does what it was supposed to do while being responsive and
                  styling and layout.

              <td>8</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Article was good. Would be better if
                  there was a context about the image added . Liked the visual
                  styling of this

                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Article was good. Would be
                  benefitted with more content and date uploaded on a side of
                  the card
                  <br />

              <td>8.5</td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  <strong>Level 1:</strong> Actually very good along with image
                  annotations. The UI/UX of Amazon/Flipkart comparison would've
                  been benefitted with consistent styling.

                  <br />

                  <strong>Level 2:</strong> Redesign was actually very good. I
                  liked the hover effect and modern interface. The IIT-M page is
                  now up to date and is modern and aesthetic
                  <br />
