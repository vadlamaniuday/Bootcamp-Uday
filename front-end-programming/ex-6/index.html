          <p>
            Brand-new Tesla vehicles are experiencing self-driving computer
            failures, which are resulting in significant problems. Inside
            sources say that the problem is contributing to overwhelming Tesla's
            service.
            <br />
            <br />
            Over the last few weeks, Electrek has received several reports from
            new Tesla buyers claiming computer failures on brand-new cars.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problem is linked to a new version of Tesla’s HW4 (sometimes
            called AI4) onboard self-driving computer. Internally, some refer to
            the new version as AI4.1. The computers are short-circuiting. The
            cause is still being investigated, but one source told Electrek that
            one of the possible causes is the low-voltage battery
            short-circuiting the computer during the camera calibration process.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>

          <p>
            Tesla drivers are reporting computer failures after driving off with
            their brand-new cars over just the first few tens to hundreds of
            miles. Wide-ranging features powered by the computer, like active
            safety features, cameras, and even GPS, navigation, and range
            estimations, fail to work.
          </p>

          <h2>My Take</h2>
          <p>
            I am not hating here. This is a significant issue that customers
            should be aware of. It is significant enough that several inside
            sources decided to reach out about it, and many customers are
            complaining about the issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would expect NHTSA to issue a recall here, and Tesla could be in
            trouble for downplaying an issue that has been going on for weeks,
            but I don’t think that’s going to happen considering what the Trump
            transition team, in which Tesla CEO Elon Musk is greatly involved,
            is signaling to the federal agency.
