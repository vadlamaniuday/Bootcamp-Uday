    <h1>FRONT-END PROGRAMMING - Exercise 6</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      I created a basic color picker website by using Vanilla JavaScript with
      Vite where users can adjust the background and table colors by picking
      colors and adjusting the HSL Sliders.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML Structure</h3>
    <p>
      HTML is structured in an article type of way along with few more changes
      with respect to addition of tables and sliders
    </p>

    <h3>Javascript Structure</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Adding event listeners to the color pickers and sliders to detect
        changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Updating the corresponding HSL values and applying them to the
        background and table elements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensuring that the updates are smooth and do not cause performance
        issues.
      </li>
    </ul>
