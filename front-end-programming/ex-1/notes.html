          The exercises in these were fairly easy. First exercise being that I
          had to use HTML/CSS/JS to add a dummy user, which was easy. Level 2 of
          this exercise was fairlyeasy as well as I had to just use the JSON
          file to show data in the frontend. Third one was a bit tricky and the
          tricky part was just setting up the AG Grid table , but the
          documentation made it pretty clear as well. Using Papaparse was kind
          of confusing with Vanilla JS.

        <p>
          One of the challenges I faced was how to work with PapaParse in Plain
          JS, it was tricky at first but I was able to get it working.

          No improvements whatsoever. Sure, the styling and table layout can be
          improved a bit further.
